## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-02

### 🎉 Initial Release

Flutist is a Flutter project management framework inspired by Tuist, providing declarative module structure and dependency management.

### ✨ Features

#### Core Commands
- **`flutist init`** - Initialize project with workspace support
- **`flutist create`** - Create modules (simple, feature, library, standard)
- **`flutist generate`** - Sync dependencies with type-safe auto-completion
- **`flutist scaffold`** - Generate code from templates (Tuist-style)
- **`flutist graph`** - Visualize module dependencies (Mermaid, DOT, ASCII)
- **`flutist run`** - Run Flutter app
- **`flutist pub`** - Manage packages

### 🏗️ Module Types
- **Simple** - Single-layer module
- **Feature** - 3-layer (Domain, Data, Presentation)
- **Library** - 5-layer (Example, Interface, Implementation, Testing, Tests)
- **Standard** - 3-layer (Implementation, Tests, Testing)

### 📦 What's Included
- Auto-generated `flutist_gen.dart` for type-safe dependencies
- Built-in feature template (BLoC pattern)
- Comprehensive `analysis_options.yaml` (100+ lint rules)
- Automatic workspace registration
- Smart relative path calculation

### 🐛 Known Issues
- iOS build requires workspace workaround (Flutter limitation)
  - **Solution**: Use Android/Web for development

### 📚 Quick Example
```bash
flutist init
flutist create --path features --name login --options library
flutist generate
flutist graph --open
```

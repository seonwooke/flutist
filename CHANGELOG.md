# Changelog

All notable changes to Flutist will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-01-02

- Added Docs badge with book icon linking to DeepWiki documentation
- Updated all documentation links to https://deepwiki.com/seonwooke/flutist
- Updated pubspec.yaml documentation field to point to DeepWiki

## [1.1.2] - 2025-01-02

### 📝 Documentation
- Updated README.md version badge to reflect current version (1.1.1)
- Fixed project structure documentation:
  - Corrected `main.dart` location to `root/lib/main.dart` (was incorrectly shown in `app/lib/main.dart`)
  - Clarified that `app.dart` belongs in `app/lib/app.dart`
- Removed `dart test` section from Development Setup (tests not yet implemented)
- Fixed duplicate `lib/` directory in project structure example

## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-02

### ✨ Added
- **Clean Architecture example repository**:
  - Added link to `flutist_clean_architecture` repository in README.md Examples section
  - Added Real-World Examples section to example/README.md
  - Showcases Clean Architecture implementation using Flutist

### 🔧 Improved
- **`flutist generate` command**:
  - Automatically removes deleted modules from `package.dart` when module files are not found
  - When a module's pubspec.yaml cannot be found (e.g., `home_domain`), extracts base module name (e.g., `home`) and removes it from `package.dart`
  - Ensures `package.dart` stays in sync with actual file system structure
  - Filters `flutist_gen.dart` modules to only include those present in `project.dart`
  - Modules removed from `project.dart` are now also removed from `flutist_gen.dart`

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed logging message format in generate command

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-02

### 🚀 Major Changes
- **Project structure update**: Moved `main.dart` from `app/lib/main.dart` to `lib/main.dart`
  - Root `lib/main.dart` now imports and runs app from `package:app/app.dart`
  - App module is automatically added as a path dependency in root `pubspec.yaml`
  - Enables direct execution with `flutter run` from root directory
  - Removed `flutist run` command - use `flutter run` directly instead

### ✨ Added
- Root `lib/main.dart` generation in `flutist init` command
- Automatic app module dependency management in root `pubspec.yaml`

### 🗑️ Removed
- **BREAKING**: `flutist run` command has been removed
  - Users should use `flutter run` directly from the project root
  - This change simplifies the toolchain and aligns with standard Flutter workflows

### 🔧 Changed
- `flutist init` now creates `lib/main.dart` in root directory instead of `app/lib/main.dart`
- Root `pubspec.yaml` template now includes app module as path dependency
- Run command references removed from documentation and help text

## [1.0.10] - 2025-01-02

### 🐛 Fixed
- **`flutist generate` command**:
  - Fixed empty dependencies section being converted from `dependencies:` to `dependencies: {}`
  - Now preserves original format when dependencies section is empty
  - Empty dependencies sections are formatted as `dependencies:` instead of `dependencies: {}`
  - Files with unchanged dependencies no longer show unnecessary format changes

## [1.0.9] - 2025-01-02

### 🐛 Fixed
- **`flutist create` command**:
  - Fixed incorrect `analysis_options.yaml` include path for layered modules (feature, library, standard)
  - Now uses `path.relative()` to correctly calculate relative path from module to root directory
  - Previously calculated depth based on `moduleRelativePath`, which was incorrect for layered modules
  - Example: `features/book_detail/book_detail_domain` now correctly uses `../../../analysis_options.yaml` instead of `../../analysis_options.yaml`

## [1.0.8] - 2025-01-02

### 🐛 Fixed
- **`flutist init` command**:
  - Fixed version detection using `dart pub global list` command instead of pubspec.yaml lookup
  - `global_packages` directory doesn't contain `pubspec.yaml`, only `pubspec.lock`
  - Now correctly reads installed flutist version from `dart pub global list` output
  - Fixes issue where version detection failed for globally installed packages via `dart pub global activate`

## [1.0.7] - 2025-01-02

### 🐛 Fixed
- **`flutist init` command**:
  - Fixed version detection when running `flutist init` after `dart pub global activate flutist`
  - Prioritized `global_packages` lookup to correctly read installed flutist version
  - Added package name validation to ensure correct `pubspec.yaml` is read
  - Simplified version detection logic by removing unnecessary directory traversal
  - Now correctly adds the installed flutist version to project dependencies instead of fallback version

## [1.0.6] - 2025-01-02

### 🔧 Improved
- **`flutist init` command**:
  - Dynamically reads flutist package version from current package's `pubspec.yaml`
  - Uses pub.dev package instead of local path reference
  - Automatically reflects version updates when `pubspec.yaml` is updated
  - Changed from hardcoded version to dynamic version reading

## [1.0.5] - 2025-01-02

### 🎨 Style
- Applied Dart formatter to example files and codebase
  - Formatted `example/flutist/flutist_gen.dart`
  - Formatted `example/package.dart`
  - Applied consistent code formatting across the project

## [1.0.4] - 2025-01-02

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed `flutist run` command creating `root/lib/main.dart` file
  - Added explicit `-t` flag to target `app/lib/main.dart` when running Flutter
  - Automatically detects and removes existing `root/lib/main.dart` if found
  - Prevents Flutter from auto-creating `root/lib/main.dart` file

## [1.0.3] - 2025-01-02

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed `flutist run` command creating unnecessary `root/lib/main.dart` file
  - Removed auto-generation logic that created `root/lib/main.dart` when missing
  - Flutter workspace automatically finds `app/lib/main.dart` when running from root directory
  - Updated README.md documentation to reflect correct behavior

## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-02

### ✨ Added
- Example directory for pub.dev with complete project structure demonstration
  - `README.md` with usage instructions and module type explanations
  - `directory_structure.md` with Microfeature Architecture visualization
  - Example `package.dart` and `project.dart` configuration files
  - Example `pubspec.yaml` with workspace configuration
  - Example `flutist_gen.dart` showing generated code structure

### 🔧 Improved
- **`flutist init` command**:
  - Prevent overwriting existing `README.md` files
  - Merge Flutist configuration into existing `pubspec.yaml` instead of overwriting
  - Automatically add `workspace` section if missing
  - Automatically add `app` module to workspace if not exists
  - Automatically add `flutist` dependency with latest version when merging
  - Fix `app.dart` import path in `main.dart` (use relative import instead of package import)
- **README.md**:
  - Add "Core Commands" section highlighting main 4 commands (`init`, `create`, `generate`, `scaffold`)
  - Add "All Commands" table at the top for quick reference
  - Improve command visibility with larger headings and bold text
  - Add `scaffold` example to Quick Start section

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed import path in generated `app/lib/main.dart` (changed from `package:app/app.dart` to `app.dart`)
- Fixed dependency getter names in example files (camelCase conversion: `shared_preferences` → `sharedPreferences`, `json_annotation` → `jsonAnnotation`)
- Suppressed warnings in example directory with custom `analysis_options.yaml`

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-02

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed README.md banner image loading issue by using GitHub raw URL instead of relative path

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-02

### 🎉 Initial Release

Flutist is a Flutter project management framework inspired by Tuist, providing declarative module structure and dependency management.

### ✨ Features

- **`flutist create`** - Create modules (simple, feature, library, standard)
- **`flutist generate`** - Sync dependencies with type-safe auto-completion
- **`flutist scaffold`** - Generate code from templates (Tuist-style)
- **`flutist graph`** - Visualize module dependencies (Mermaid, DOT, ASCII)
- **`flutist run`** - Run Flutter app
- **`flutist pub`** - Manage packages

### 🏗️ Module Types
- **Simple** - Single-layer module
- **Feature** - 3-layer (Domain, Data, Presentation)
- **Library** - 5-layer (Example, Interface, Implementation, Testing, Tests)
- **Standard** - 3-layer (Implementation, Tests, Testing)

### 📦 What's Included
- Auto-generated `flutist_gen.dart` for type-safe dependencies
- Built-in feature template (BLoC pattern)
